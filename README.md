# ascii-effect
A little ascii-art effect in javascript. Own images can be loaded and converted to ASCII-art.
Controls for the resolution are included.

This is a project following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeT-5RZgEQY&t=587s
I modularized and refactored the original project to my own liking.

The project uses html canvas to analyze an image and return an ASCII-Art version of it.
Images can be added from the script.js function as the source of the image1 variable.
