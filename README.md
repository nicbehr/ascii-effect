# ascii-effect

![A dark souls image in ASCII-art style which was created with this project](/gui_example/example.jpg?raw=true)

A little ascii-art effect in javascript. Own images can be loaded and converted to ASCII-art.
Controls for the resolution are included.

This is a project following this video by Franks Laboratory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeT-5RZgEQY&t=587s

I modularized and refactored parts of the original project to my own liking.

The project uses html canvas to analyze an image and return an ASCII-Art version of it.  
Images can be added from the script.js function as the source of the image1 variable.
